# Multiple Variable Linear Regression for Predictive Analysis

This repository contains an implementation of a multiple linear regression model for predictive analysis. The model explores the relationship between multiple independent variables and a dependent variable, aiming to predict outcomes based on given input features.

## Overview

Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between two or more independent variables and a single dependent variable. In this project, we aim to predict the dependent variable by considering multiple independent variables. This predictive analysis can be useful in various fields such as finance, economics, healthcare, and more.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and to scale the features if necessary.
- Model Training: The multiple linear regression model is trained using the preprocessed dataset.
- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.
- Feature Importance: Insights into the importance of each feature in predicting the dependent variable are provided.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target). It is important to understand the nature of the dataset and the relationship between variables before proceeding with the analysis.

## Usage

Modify the `main.py` script according to your specific dataset and requirements. Ensure that the data preprocessing steps are suitable for your dataset. You can also customize the evaluation metrics and feature selection methods based on your needs.
